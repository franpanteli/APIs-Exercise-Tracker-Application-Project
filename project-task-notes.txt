These are my notes on the project task page. This project is called "Exercise Tracker." The URL for the page which these notes are on is https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/exercise-tracker

- We are building a full-stack JavaScript application:
	-> This must be similar in functionality to this https://exercise-tracker.freecodecamp.rocks/
	-> For the `date` property, the `toDateString` method can be used 
	-> This method belongs to the `Date` API 

- Methods to write this code:
	Method #1: clone the boilerplate code from their GitHub repository 
		-> Complete the exercise locally
		-> Start on this boilerplate code https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-exercisetracker/

	Method #2: They have a Gitpod starter project which you can use to complete the project

	Method #3: Using a site builder
		-> They don't specify which site builder 
		-> You can use a site builder to complete the project
		-> It needs to include all of the files from the project Github boilerplate code
		-> These files need to be included for the assessment tests when the project is submitted 

- An example structure response: 

    Input exercise into the tracker:
    {
      username: "fcc_test",
      description: "test",
      duration: 60,
      date: "Mon Jan 01 1990",
      _id: "5fb5853f734231456ccb3b05"
    }

    Input user into the tracker:
    {
      username: "fcc_test",
      _id: "5fb5853f734231456ccb3b05"
    }

    The log which this should produce:
    {
      username: "fcc_test",
      count: 1,
      _id: "5fb5853f734231456ccb3b05",
      log: [{
        description: "test",
        duration: 60,
        date: "Mon Jan 01 1990",
      }]
    }
